In this lecture we are going to continue learning about advanced concepts in React.

Let us start with some jargon, SPA or single page applications are applications that don't get hard refresh everytime something changes on the website or a new page opens up and rather use AJAX(async JS and XML) to compute these requests.

Next is client side bundle is the bundle which you will get from backend, which is all the code and data that sent to the browser as packets that will get rendered on your browser and form the website

Last is client side routing, code you write as the application developer which routes and redirects user to relevant section when they want to go to specific pages.
